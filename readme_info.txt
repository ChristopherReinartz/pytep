Put stuff that should be part of the readme into this file. 

In order to avoid constant popups about autosaved versions of the simulink model when using pytep, disable the Autosave option for simulink.
Open Matlab -> Preferences (in Environment section) -> Simulink preferences -> Disable autosave before simulation.
